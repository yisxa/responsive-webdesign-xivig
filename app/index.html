            <p>There were six people who loved to watch television, but they didn't like what they saw. <a href="">Armed with determination</a> and a strong will to change the course of television, they wrote their own shows, but that wasn't enough, they
              had to sell them. They went straight to the networks, but the networks were not ready for them. But did that stop them? No. They built their own network and they liked what they saw.</p>

            <p>My name is <strong>Rhoda Morgenstern.</strong> I was born in the Bronx, New York in December of 1941. I've always felt responsible for World War II. The first thing I remember liking that liked me back was food. I had a bad puberty; I ran
              to Minneapolis, where it's cold and I figured I'd keep better. Now I'm back in Manhattan. New York, this is your last chance!</p>

            <p>When my get-up-and-go has got up and went, I hanker for a hunk o' cheese! When I'm dancin' a hoedown and my boots kinda slow down, or anytime I'm weak in the knees... I hanker for a hunk of, a slab or slice or chunk of, a snack a day's a winner
              yeah, I'm mad about you. <strong>Whoo hoo hoo.</strong></p>
